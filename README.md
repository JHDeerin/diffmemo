**DiffMemo** is a simple tool to help with memorizing text. Paste the text you want to memorize, try to write it out, and see where you made mistakes. Your text will persist across browser refreshes.

This is a generalization of what I did in my [Sermon on the Mount in 111 Days](https://jhdeerin.github.io/sermon-mt-111-days) project. Nearly all the code was generated via Claude Code, using Opus 4.5.
